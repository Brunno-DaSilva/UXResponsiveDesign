CSS FRAMEWORK 1:
What is the name of this framework?
- Materialize
What company maintains this framework? 
-Google
What does it advertise about itself to appeal to potential users?
- Free Templates
- User Friendly
- Speeds up user development
- UX Focus
How do you include this framework on your own site if you want to use it? Does it have a CDN?
-You must link the files on your homepage using HTML. To access the framework you can use NPM, CDN or Bower.
Does it have a grid system? If yes, describe how that grid system works.
-Yes, it has a standard 12 column fluid responsive grid system. It uses a container for laying out content on your webpage.
i.e. <div class="container">
Find an example of a website that uses this framework. How much does it differ from the default appearance?
-Gmail. Without Materialize, there's not as much responsiveness. Without Materialize there would not be the 12 columns. 
Does this framework have an icon set? If yes, include a code snippet of how you'd use one.
-Yes. For the "Start a meeting" button on gmail.com:
@media (min-resolution: 144dpi), (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5)
<style>
.aHS-YH .qj {
    background-image: url(blob:https://mail.google.com/228f15f1-2fb6-40e7-8d94-5ac1f0a34fc0);
}
Take a look at the buttons section of the docs. How do this framework's buttons compare to a plain HTML button?
-In Materialize, the buttons are linked to images. There are responsive buttons that you can raise, float, or change in color.
Take a look at some of the default menu options (such as for page headers and footers) and pick one you think looks the best. How difficult are these to implement? Are they responsive? How difficult do you think something like this would be to implement without the help of the framework?

Looking at the header of parallax template, components are pretty straight forward: h1, background image, button. Looks pretty easy to implement. Header is responsive to resizing between desktop and phone/ipad as well as having a responsive button; puddle effect with onclick. Would be very difficult to implement without framework due to onclick event.
CSS FRAMEWORK 2:
What is the name of this framework?
-Mobi
What company maintains this framework?
-Open Souce - MIT License
What does it advertise about itself to appeal to potential users?

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/mobi.css/dist/mobi.min.css" />
It does have a CDN
Does it have a grid system? If yes, describe how that grid system works.

COMPARE AND CONTRAST:
Which framework do you think looks nicer?
-Materialize 
Which framework is easier to use?
-Materialize (Mobi may be better for mobile apps)
Which of these two frameworks would you choose to use for a project and why?
-It depends on the goal of the project.
If we were to build a mobile app, we would go with mobi.
If it were just a regular web app, we would choose materialize.
