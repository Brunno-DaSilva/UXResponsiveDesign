CSS FRAMEWORK 1:
What is the name of this framework?
Bulma
What company maintains this framework?

- Known for simple use and customize for your site
How do you include this framework on your own site if you want to use it? Does it have a CDN?
- npm, CDN, and GitHub repository
Does it have a grid system? If yes, describe how that grid system works.
- Yes, a CSS framework based on Flexbox
- Adding columns and they resize themselves based on number of columns

- Change the size and responsiveness
Find an example of a website that uses this framework. How much does it differ from the default appearance?
Mythril.io
- it differs a lot from the basic columns I see in the Bulma homepage
- It isn’t just basic columns but looks like one column at the top is floating on its own
- Also has effects for the side scrolling with arrows
- Picture and text within the container
Does this framework have an icon set? If yes, include a code snippet of how you’d use one.
- Bulma is compatible with all icon font libraries.
- <span class="icon">
<i class="fas fa-home"></i>
</span>
- icon class is a reliable square container
- icon sized accordingly to the icon library you are using
- the icons can be customized
Take a look at the buttons section of the docs. How do this framework’s buttons compare to a plain HTML button?
- different colors, light version, various sizes, inverted, rounded
- pseudo-class for the buttons
- disabled
- fonts and icons within button
Take a look at some of the default menu options (such as for page headers and footers) and pick one you think looks the best. How difficult are these to implement? Are they responsive? How difficult do you think something like this would be to implement without the help of the framework?
- navigation bar or sidebar
- it would be difficult to implement without a framework as we would have to create a menu/nav bar from scratch and define each element/style

Materialize

- navigation bar or sidebar
- Materialize makes it easy to impliment by giving you the bare bones to then build off of. There is code snipitts all over the page that allow you to easily add it into any html and start customizing. These are also responsive yes.
