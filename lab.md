# Framework Lab (Billy, Lam-Ahn, Steven)
Framework 1: Foundation
1. Foundation CSS
2. Zurb
3. Speed for users, customizable and professional semantics. Separate tool for customizable emails
4. Download entire folder, use a CDN,  use Node package.
5. Has a grid system. XY, Float, and Flex grids. 
    XY: The structure of XY uses .grid-x, .grid-xy, and .cell at its base. 
6. Washington Post. They previously used Bootstrap, but discovered that Foundation is much faster.
7. Yes, Foundation Icons Font 3. 
<i class="fi-star">Star</i>
8. To implement a Foundation button, 
    <button type="button" class="success button">Save</button>
    Solid green color, white text. Straight edge boundary
9. Without foundation, we would need to build their drop-down menu from scratch with JavaScript. They're responsive.
    
Framework 2: Materialize 
1. Materialize
2. Google
3. Speed, UX focus, easy to work with.
4. Download entire folder, use a CDN, NPM, or Bower.
5. Has a standard 12 column fluid responsive grid system.
6. Kiosk Browser - Couldn't find information about what a website looked like before Materialize, all of the websites on their showcase are intuitive, minimalist, and aesthetically pleasing. 
7. Yes it does.

      <i class="material-icons">add</i>
    Import icons with:
          <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">

8.  To implement a Materialize button:
      <a class="btn-floating btn-large waves-effect waves-light red"><i class="material-icons">add</i></a>
    Rounder edges, drop shadow, colorful, and variability.
9. The default menu options are responsive and look difficult to implement. If you were to build the Materialize Navbar from scratch, you would have to create animations using either CSS or JavaScript. 

Compare/Contrast
1. Materialize looks nicer, more intuitive, and because it is managed by Google the buttons are familiar.
2. We like Materialize -
3. Materialize, because it is more intuitive.
